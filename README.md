# Postgresql_alchemy_demo
This is  project to show how we can operate on a PostgreSQL db using a python interface to handle orders and adjust the quantity in our warehouse

I am currently running a Postgre SQL Db on Docker, this will be evident in the connetion I use 
to access it trought SQL_alchemy. I have prefereed SQL_alchemy because it allows a better compatibility with pandas dataframe (That I am personally used 
to manipulate almost every day in the job I have at the moment I am writing)
